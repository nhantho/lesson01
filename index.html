      <h4>The Palos Verdes blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis) </h4>
      <p>is a small endangered butterfly native to the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwest Los Angeles County, California, United States. As its distribution has been proven to be limited to one single site it has one of the best claims to being the world's rarest butterfly.</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Palos Verdes blue butterfly has a wingspan of only 25–30 mm (0.98–1.18 in). The <em>male</em> has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the <em>female's</em> dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray colour. <strong>Both</strong> males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings.</p><br>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
          <p>G. lygdamus palosverdesensis persists particularly on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 15 miles south of Los Angeles, in a coastal sage scrub habitat. This species is locally monophagous, or particular to one species of food plant.</p><br>
        <h3>Life Stages</h3>
          <p>Oviposition, laying of eggs on the larval food plant, occurs only once a breeding season for the Palos Verdes blue. There are at least four larval instars, or stages of development. Their adult lifespan is only five days.</p><br>
        <h3>Conservation</h3>
          <h4>Laws</h4>
            <p>G. lygdamus palosverdesensis was listed as an "endangered species" by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. This listing also included city-owned critical habitat, plus comments and recommendations for species conservation. Insects are not currently protected by California laws.</p>
          <h4>Threats</h4>
            <p>The main threat to the Palos Verdes blue has been habitat destruction due to weeds and rototilling, which has negative effects on the essential larval food plants. Recreational, commercial, or residential development of the Palos Verdes Peninsula is also a major concern in preservation of the food plants.</p>
          <h4>Reintroduction</h4>
            <p>The Defense Logistics Agency has funded habitat restoration and a breeding program for the blue butterfly. Honey, produced on the premises, is provided to the captive rearing program so the butterflies are able to feed on the same food source as its wild companions.</p><br>
